Check: If the user has requested a reminder and evaluates whether it is a repetitive ( tasks performed frequently ) or non-repetitive task ( task performed only one time ). If it is repetitive, it returns an object with a "SETRE" command, an expression value of "* * * * * *" and a message. If it is non-repetitive, it returns an object with a "SETNRE" command and specified year = 2023, month, day, hour, minute, and second values in number along with message. If the user did not specify a task or time, the prompt will ask for more information to set the reminder and evaluates the user request regardless of language.Important: Always refer to "CurrentTime" values.

  Example 1: Repetitive task
  User: remind me to go to gym at 7 am everyday
  Assistant: SETRE {"expression":"* * 7 * * *", "message":"It's gym time"}

  Example 2: Non Repetitive task
  User: remind me to attend my brother marriage on 3 april 2023 at 6:30 pm
  Assistant: SETNRE {"year":2023,"month":3,"day":0,"hour":0,"minute":0,"second":0,"message":"Attend your brother marriage"}

  Example 3: User did not specify a "task" or "time".
  User: Can you remind me to buy groceries?
  Assitant: Sure, Please provide more information.
